voc.txt and output.txt are derived from the Digital Pāḷi Dictionary which is licensed under a Creative Commons License: https://digitalpalidictionary.github.io/

To create the files, I downloaded their latest SQL Database and ran the following query:

```sql
SELECT DISTINCT lemma_2, stem
FROM dpd_headwords
WHERE
  stem IS NOT "*" AND
  stem IS NOT "-" AND 
  stem NOT LIKE "!%";
```

I then exported the lemma_2 column to voc.txt and the stem column to output.txt.

Note: to run the Pali stemmer, run:

stemwords -l pali -c UTF_8 -i pali/voc.txt -o pali/real_output.txt
